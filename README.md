🌱 Agribusiness Seed Selection App
An application/website designed to assist in the selection and analysis of agribusiness seeds, starting with corn seeds, using YOLO object detection technology for high accuracy and precision.

The system supports five types of cameras for different analysis scenarios:

📱 Casual (Cell phone, GoPro)

🌈 RGN

🎨 RGB

🌌 NIR (Near-Infrared)

🔴 RE (Red Edge)

It also offers:

Live video detection in real time.

Compatibility for both desktop and mobile devices.

Flexible camera selection on the start screen.

🚀 Features
YOLO-based detection for precise seed classification.

Camera selection menu on the initial page.

Real-time video analysis for fast and dynamic monitoring.

Support for different camera types used in agribusiness.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Backend & Processing)

YOLOv8 (Object detection)

OpenCV (Image & video processing)

Streamlit (Web interface)

Android Studio (optional) – for mobile app version
